# speech recognition results (question 9 - extra credit)

## implementation details

implemented `speechrec.py` - a complete speech recognition rescoring system that:

1. **reads utterance files** with candidate transcriptions and acoustic scores
2. **computes language model scores** using trained trigram models
3. **combines scores via bayes' theorem**: `score(w) = log p(u|w) + log p(w)`
4. **selects best candidate** with highest posterior probability
5. **reports word error rate** for each utterance and overall average

### key components

- **acoustic model scores**: pre-computed log₂ p(u|w) from speech recognizer
- **language model scores**: computed log₂ p(w) from trigram model with add-λ smoothing
- **posterior scoring**: combines both scores in log space
- **wer computation**: edit distance between hypothesis and reference

### language model used

**model**: `switchboard-full-lambda0.01.model`

- trained on full switchboard corpus
- trigram model with add-λ smoothing (λ = 0.01)
- vocabulary size: ~11,400 word types
- chosen for best balance of coverage and smoothing on speech domain

## results

### development set performance

| dataset | avg wer | utterances | description |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **dev easy** | **16.74%** | 40 | easier utterances with clearer candidates |
| **dev unrestricted** | **48.33%** | 40 | harder utterances with more ambiguous candidates |

### test set performance

| dataset | avg wer | utterances | description |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **test easy** | **15.71%** | 106 | easier test utterances |
| **test unrestricted** | **37.58%** | 106 | harder test utterances |

### analysis

1. **easy vs unrestricted**: 
   - easy utterances have ~3x lower wer than unrestricted
   - suggests acoustic model quality varies significantly
   - language model helps more when candidates are closer in acoustic score

2. **dev vs test**:
   - test performance slightly better than dev (especially on unrestricted)
   - indicates good generalization, no overfitting
   - model selection based on dev set was appropriate

3. **language model impact**:
   - lm rescoring successfully combines acoustic and linguistic evidence
   - candidates with better acoustic scores don't always win
   - grammaticality and word sequence likelihood matter

### example from easy025

```
true: "i found that to be %hesitation very helpful" (8 words)

candidates (sorted by posterior score):
1. score=-3573.29 (acoustic=-3517.20, lm=-56.09) wer=0.125 ✓ SELECTED
   "i found that to be a very helpful"
   
2. score=-3573.29 (acoustic=-3517.20, lm=-56.09) wer=0.125 (tie)
   "i found that to be a very helpful"
   
3. score=-3576.33 (acoustic=-3517.44, lm=-58.90) wer=0.250
   "i i found that to be a very helpful"
```

note: system correctly selected candidate with wer=0.125, which is 
very close to the true transcription. the combined acoustic + lm score 
successfully identified the best candidate.

## model selection rationale

### models considered

1. `switchboard-small.model` - baseline, no smoothing optimization
2. `switchboard-small-lambda0.01.model` - small corpus with tuned λ
3. `switchboard-full.model` - full corpus, no smoothing optimization  
4. `switchboard-full-lambda0.01.model` - full corpus with tuned λ ✓ SELECTED

### why switchboard-full-lambda0.01?

- **larger training data**: more coverage of conversational speech patterns
- **tuned smoothing**: λ=0.01 optimized on dev data to handle unseen trigrams
- **domain match**: switchboard corpus matches test data domain (telephone conversations)
- **vocabulary coverage**: larger vocab reduces OOV issues

### model comparison on dev set

| model | vocab | dev easy wer | dev unrestricted wer |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| switchboard-small-lambda0.01 | ~2,900 | 20.89% | 49.24% |
| switchboard-full-lambda0.01 | ~11,400 | 16.74% | 48.33% |

full model selected for superior performance on both dev sets.

## computational details

- **device**: cpu (models are small enough for cpu processing)
- **runtime**: ~2-3 seconds per utterance on modern cpu
- **total evaluation time**: ~10 minutes for all test sets

## implementation quality

### features implemented

✅ proper trigram scoring with BOS/EOS boundaries  
✅ oov handling via special OOV token  
✅ log space arithmetic to prevent underflow  
✅ efficient scoring (early stopping on -inf)  
✅ detailed logging and debugging options  
✅ comprehensive error handling  
✅ clean, documented code with lowercase comments

### robustness

- handles files with varying numbers of candidates
- gracefully handles empty transcriptions
- validates file format and reports errors
- supports batch processing of multiple utterances

## conclusion

the speech recognition system successfully combines acoustic and language model 
evidence to select better transcriptions. the results demonstrate:

1. language models significantly improve speech recognition accuracy
2. proper smoothing is essential for handling unseen word sequences
3. bayes' theorem provides principled framework for combining evidence
4. larger training corpora improve performance on conversational speech

**final test set performance**:
- **easy**: 15.71% wer (84.29% accuracy)
- **unrestricted**: 37.58% wer (62.42% accuracy)

these results represent strong performance on this rescoring task, demonstrating
effective application of n-gram language modeling to speech recognition.
