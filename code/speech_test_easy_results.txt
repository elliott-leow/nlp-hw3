0.167	easy066	one and five americans can't read
0.158	easy067	i always thought the teaches never got paid nearly enough i mean that to be doing what they're doing uh
0.125	easy068	so you know we're we're thinking about
0.125	easy069	that i was what twelve years ago i guess
0.133	easy070	what gets me is i can't believe that congress uh our our state legislature can't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have on the school
0.429	easy071	but yet it is a scary thought
0.200	easy072	i've got a little [doggie] uh they've had quite uh quite a long time
0.125	easy073	when i was uh married my uh ex wife it said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she did
0.250	easy074	the uh the women needed someone to baby sit

0.062	easy078	i know like when she had an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose
0.133	easy079	which which she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
0.167	easy080	but you know having a dog
0.273	easy081	because they went through the public school system in boston
0.059	easy082	and i still didn't even i i i couldn't put together a map to the united states
0.143	easy083	and that people are uh leaving school would not even knowing some common sense things
0.333	easy084	i think it's um someplace in new york because there has been budget problems they're closing the library
0.167	easy085	and um i don't know
0.067	easy086	and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i said
0.222	easy087	and it's probably pretty sad thing to say
0.000	easy088	and um i i really felt like i've been working now for about four years
0.125	easy089	and they know that i'm drawing a lot of what i learned in school you know
0.118	easy090	well um in the public schools i guess there was there are a lot of you know
0.350	easy091	our state just cut a whole bunch of uh i think i think it's ten million dollars of the schools was it
0.000	easy092	i play basketball uh a couple times a week
0.000	easy093	i play softball one night a week
0.100	easy094	how long does it take you to get to work
0.182	easy095	and i learned all the health benefits of idea
0.059	easy096	so once i got into this uh internship i learned all the [physiological] and and advantages to it
0.095	easy097	but uh i'm looking at uh i do a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it
0.000	easy098	i've never really looked into that
0.182	easy099	i mean or um texas you you got about five or six
0.136	easy100	if you ever in the dallas area got five or six every weekend to choose from because they're really into it
0.211	easy101	i i didn't know that you know until i came down here in kind of caught the fever
0.125	easy102	but i lived in indiana all my life
0.154	easy103	but other than just nothing up there like it is down here
0.200	easy104	as much of a hundred fifty miles a week
0.125	easy105	and i backpack a lot of the summer
0.143	easy106	so that's about the extent of it
0.167	easy107	uh about forty five minutes
0.125	easy108	uh i basically uh i work on a campus
0.267	easy109	uh but it's there's enough of a pain but i did it [consist] only one year
0.111	easy110	it's it's uh pretty [kiddy] up here i think
0.333	easy111	i can't believe this
0.167	easy112	and having all kinds of [sect]
0.294	easy113	because if they ever come over the reasonable working agent place a [fluorocarbons] then uh
0.091	easy114	we are doing some things to try to correct problem
0.182	easy115	well we are doing a pretty [remiss] in our group too
0.167	easy116	i'm so [stocked] up right now
0.077	easy117	well what can we do about the the the air conditioning problem
0.286	easy118	and they just started started doing that
0.286	easy119	but uh i have been the pros
0.182	easy120	and i i think that uh they need guidance an assistants
0.286	easy121	the the grass and the uh [pails] down there are an [excepted] way
0.143	easy122	but it it uh it is a problem
0.182	easy123	it shows the the uh [unpreparedness] for such such a problem
0.258	easy124	i think the first the law power financially uh [governmentally] every which way was in the hands of such if you that there is not the middle class that we we perceive
0.167	easy125	and when i went down the kids they had to get out
0.182	easy126	uh so uh i would say that's probably a pride motivation
0.083	easy127	all right now i think uh we are about thirty thousand people
0.167	easy128	course at our [paper's] state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever
0.111	easy129	i don't know if you're in a big city
0.214	easy130	some people i guess they need i've got to make sure that they are going to get shot because of the incidences the break ins and you know
0.059	easy131	but uh all we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up
0.167	easy132	i've had to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess
0.364	easy133	and i would certainly golfer of band on certain types
0.154	easy134	of course those are two different [issue's] as far as privacy goes
0.167	easy135	so and it's kind of a
0.095	easy136	and then you've got a group people that decide that there's there's no particular reason to have them at all
0.053	easy137	and i guess i would fall more in the in the realm that i like the sport issue of it
0.091	easy138	but i uh i could give it up without too much trouble
0.105	easy139	so uh i i don't see the the joy of shooting is it that much of a driving factor
0.107	easy140	i think that society could easily swing the scale the other direction just for the sake of safety the the number kids tend to get hurt
0.222	easy141	i don't even keeps a gun in our house
0.048	easy142	you know the very few of those [burgers] actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming
0.250	easy143	have time to do anything about it
0.125	easy144	are you probably know a lot about it
0.143	easy145	and uh the whole thing the small
0.143	easy146	well i thought there was the medical benefits that we have learned from society
0.091	easy147	well he came to go into a lot of detail sometimes
0.111	easy148	i have to live not too far away from
0.077	easy149	and uh you know that's been kind of a real magazine feeling here
0.125	easy150	i have a sister lives in dallas
0.000	easy151	it's a very complex uh situation to go into space
0.091	easy152	well i painted the outside of my house in one bathroom
0.231	easy153	uh well are you willing to paint the outside of your house to
0.167	easy154	we did in the fall
0.167	easy155	and it's just it's too hot
0.667	easy156	you may be hundred fifty
0.182	easy157	i think i'm going to do it this spring actually
0.000	easy158	i was out there last week
0.167	easy159	and i think he drives me a hundred dollars to finish it up
0.136	easy160	i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption the government um how many people are still serving
0.167	easy161	i think everybody could piano lessons
0.167	easy162	and we got pretty bored quickly
0.375	easy163	i never really like the music great
0.111	easy164	well that do do you play any musical instruments or
